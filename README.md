SharpHabit is a small personal project I use to experiment, learn, and practice.

The idea is simple:  
a habit tracker where you can track daily habits, see monthly progress, and visualize completion over time.

This project is **not meant to be perfect or production-ready**.  
It’s a place where I:
- learn new concepts
- experiment with ideas
- improve my coding skills step by step

I also use it for myself, and sometimes share it with friends.

In the future, I may continue developing it, refactor parts of it, or change the direction completely — depending on what I want to learn next.
